A Verilog HDL version of the old MOS 6502 CPU.

Have fun. 

Notes on the cpu core:

- clk is active on the positive edge (is a phi1 clock)
- reset, IRQ and NMI are active high
- WE replaces, and is inverse sense of, read not write.
- databus has separate DI and DO
- RDY is not implemented
- external memory is assumed synchronous, so external pipelining is needed
- `define SIM for extra simulation instrumentation
- memory accesses may diverge from the original

whatever purpose, as long as you don't blame me when it doesn't work."
